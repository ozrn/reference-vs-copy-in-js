    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice(); // it will make a copy of an entire array!

    // one way



    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
